                    | Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making
                    | it illegal to
                    | transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most
                    | of the popular
                    | online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight,
                    | online casino
                    | players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the
                    | online casino
                    | industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to
                    | operate under a
                    | different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from
                    | them legal. A major
                    | part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new
                    | clarification and start doing
                    | business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept
