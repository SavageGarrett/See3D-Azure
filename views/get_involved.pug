          | See3D is a network of people who are enthusiastic about making the world more accessible for blind people with 3D printing. We collaborate on Slack to design, print, and distribute models that have been requested. 
          | We also write descriptions of models and transcribe information into braille. Models printed by volunteers are sent to See3D in Ohio, and See3D distributes the models to the recipient
