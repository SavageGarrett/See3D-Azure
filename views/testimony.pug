                    | I am blind, and needed a tactile representation of the different parts of the eye while studying for my AT certification.
                    | My AT certification requires knowledge of many areas of study, including ocular conditions, light pathways into the eye, 
                    | and a degree of medical terminology pertaining to the eye.
                    | Although I recalled a degree of eye anatomy from high school (when I could still see), I wanted to feel the position of the cornea, iris, pupil, 
                    | vitreous fluid, and so on.
                    p
                    | Upon listening to my weekly newsletter of Flying Blind, I stumbled upon See 3D.
                    | I listened to a podcast describing the impetus of See 3D, and LOVED it!
                    | I received a response from Caroline Karbowski via email, and she sent an wonderful 3D-printed eyeball with its parts along with braille labels attached.
                    | In addition, Caroline provided a braille embossed guide explaining each of the labels on the eyeball for me to read along, and understand the single-lettered braille labels.
                    p
                    | This is a great organization, and I continue to promote it to other blind/visually impaired individuals to use as a source for learning tactilely.  
                    | I will also contact See 3D for further models in order to assist in my teaching abilities to represent content on a computer screen, smartphone, 
                    | or any other concepts that cannot be seen by a blind individuals.

                    | When I received the model, I became even more excited since with age and complete vision loss, I have begun to forget what certain things look like.
                    | Since then, I’ve requested models of a Moebius ring and a Klein bottle. These weird shapes are fascinating and I find myself exploring the model while my brain is busy doing its thing.
