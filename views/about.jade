          | See3D is a tax-exempt, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that began in 2017 as a way to provide 3D printing project ideas for people who were enthusiastic about printing, but were unsure what to create. We created an online system to organize requests and connect with volunteers to print models.

          | People have requested models so they can better understand objects that are often observed visually or have been difficult to create in an accessible tactile form. Common model requests include maps, buildings, snowflakes, molecules, animals, and automobiles. 3D printing does not just benefit those who are blind, it benefits everyone because handling a tactile model opens opportunities to discover something new that may not have been as noticeable in a picture or verbal description.
