// A note from Garrett: I recommend working on this page iteratively - a few lines at a time
// Getting ahead too far before testing for errors will cause you to lose track of errors and make them harder to find
// I recommend using a working page, such as team.pug as a reference in case you have errors you are struggling to find
// Make sure to pay attention to coding conventions which are outlined in some comments.
// I've also remembered how annnoying tabbing with comments is in pug and you will want to be careful.
// Make sure the comments before a line of code are at the same level of tabbing or further
// Otherwise if they are at a lower tabbing level than the proceeding code, all code at that tabbing level will be commented out.
// Visually this turns red for me, but I'm not sure if it notifies the screen reader for you.
//end of note.

// Note from Emril Bennett: It does not, but it will anounce if something is at a different tab level, so please, to any incoming blind developers, pay attention to your screen reader output.
//if your screen reader is not anouncing tab leveling, feel free to consult the user guide for your particular product for configuration directions.
//end of note.
// First include the layout.pug file below this line. This will give you access to several mixins, which are useful for creating the the repeated header and footer.
// You can do this by typing include ./layout.pug
// This will not yet show anything visually on the website.
include ./layout.pug 

//include further mixins
include ./mixins.pug 
// Next, add the header of the page, by calling the header mixin. Remember calling mixins in pug require a + before the function call
// the header function takes two parameters, first the title that will show up on the tab and second a page title which will display on the page
// Tab Titles use the naming convention "See3D - Page Name" make sure to pay attention to capitalization
// Page titles use a convention that the first letter of each word is capitalized
// Make sure to confirm you see the header on the site before proceeding
+header("See3D - Accessibility", "Accessibility Resources")
// Next, we are going to create some visual sections on the website.
// First create a div element with a class of popular_catagory_area
// Emril Bennett
//That was added. 
.popular_catagory_area
  // This is going to set up the margins on either side of the page for the content
  // This can be done by doing .popular_catagory_area
  // pug automatically creates a div with a css class of classname by doing .classname
  // Note: catagory is spelled wrong in the css class there is an a instead of an e in the word category because whoever created our template couldn't spell
  // Tabbing up one level (2 spaces) create a div with class of container
  //Emril Bennett
  //Attempting to add the container div
  .container 
    // This tells a library called bootstrap we are going to create a container of horizontal rows
    // Tabbing up another level (2 more spaces) create a div with class of row
    //Emril Bennett
    //attempts another div
    .row
      // This tells bootstrap we are defining the row of content
      // Tabbing up another level (2 more spaces) create a div with a class of col-lg-12
      //Emril Bennett
      //interesting name for a class, but I will attempt.
      .col-lg-12
        // This is where the magic of bootstrap comes in
    .row
      .col-lg-12
        h3 general 
        // You can easily create vertically divided columns with the number on the end of the class. 12 denotes full width
        // With the lg, lg can be replaced by sm, md, lg, or xl to control sizing based on different screen sizes
        // In this example we use col-lg-12 to do full width on all screen sizes
        // If this were to be replaced by two divs with col-lg-6 there will be 2 vertical columns next to each other on large screen sizes 
        // Tabbing up another level (2 more spaces) create an h3 with text of Resources for Front End Development
        // This can be done by typing h3 Text to Go Inside h3 Tag

          |In order to get started with us, you will need to know your way around a few different applications.
          |Firstly, Let's discuss slack.
          |No matter the role, effective communication is essential to the organization, and knowing how to work efficiently through Slack will make your communication quicker, easier, and more effective.
          | If you are blind or visually impaired, we have provided some useful links for using Slack:
          ul.unordered-list(style='padding-bottom: 1px;')
            li
              a.text-link(href='https://slack.com/help/articles/360000411963-Use-a-screen-reader-with-Slack-on-desktop') Using Slack with a Screen Reader
