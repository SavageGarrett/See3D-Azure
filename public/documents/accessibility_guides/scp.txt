SCP is useful for uploading documents to the see3d server, as we have not yet figured out how to upload files to VS Code yet in an accessible manner
This writeup assumes some basic knowledge of traversing files in a linux system.

1. On your local terminal or power shell you will use the scp command
2. The scp command takes two arguments, first a source file and second a destination
3. Here's an example usage first with powershell and second with a linux/mac terminal:
Note the differences in backwards and forwards slashes used by windows vs. linux
scp .\Downloads\test.png user@40.76.54.72:/home/user
scp ./Downloads/test.png user@40.76.54.72:/home/user
4. Make sure to replace the word user with the see3d server username you have been given
5. This example shows uploading a file called test.png in the downloads folder to your home directory in the see3d linux server.
6. The first argument is the local file on your machine
7. The second argument is your see3d ssh login followed by a : and then followed by the directory to send the file to on the server.
8. Upon running this command you will be prompted for your see3d password. Upon entering it you will be given the status of how far the file has uploaded.
