                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>See3D is a tax-exempt, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that began in 2017 as a way to provide 3D printing project ideas for people who were enthusiastic about printing, but were unsure what to create. We created an online system to organize requests and connect with volunteers to print models. </p>
                <p>People have requested models so they can better understand objects that are often observed visually or have been difficult to create in an accessible tactile form. Common model requests include maps, buildings, snowflakes, molecules, animals, and automobiles. 3D printing does not just benefit those who are blind, it benefits everyone because handling a tactile model opens opportunities to discover something new that may not have been as noticeable in a picture or verbal description.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect people who are blind and sighted through 3D printing, so all can gain new perspectives </li>
                    <li>Organize the printing and distribution of 3D printed models for educational purposes for people who are blind </li>
                    <li>Spread awareness of the importance of accessible materials, and independent living skills</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Our Founder</h3>
                <p>Caroline Karbowski is from Cincinnati, OH and is a second-year biology undergraduate at The Ohio State University. Her passion for 3D printing for people who are blind started with her desire to learn braille in 6th grade so she could read books in the car without becoming dizzy. After seeing how 3D printing could be used to make telescope and microscope images tactile and accessible, she became inspired to create See3D, which organizes the printing and distribution of 3D printed models for people who are blind. Caroline enjoys visiting schools for the blind, going to conventions, and sharing the ideas she has learned.</p>
